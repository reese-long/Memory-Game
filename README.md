# Memory-Game
This is a game to exercise ones visual/spatial memory. It lives entirely on the front end and was made using HTML, CSS, Javascript and jquery.

The flow of the game is as follows:
- The starting dimensions of the grid are 2 X 2
- At the start of each level a predetermined number of the total tiles turn yellow (these are the target tiles)
- The tiles then all return to the same color, and it is up to the player to select the target tiles
- If too many incorrect guesses are made the player is returned to the previous level
- If the player moves on the the next level the grid grows in size
- The number of target tiles and the exposure time for the target tiles varies based on the current level
